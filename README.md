# llmInference
A simple CLI chat interface to call API and talk to ChatGPT and Claude written in C. I wrote this because I want to utilize old machine. I am talking `pentium-m` old where it is technically internet capable, but not so in a way that you can easily use the modern web browser. 

This code is written with the help of AI. There are parts that can be optimized but I am pretty surprised myself that it is working well.

## Requirements
* `libcurl`
* `cJSON`
* some complier
